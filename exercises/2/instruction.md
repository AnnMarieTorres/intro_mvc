# Exercise 2 - Data Binding Events

Add functionality to the Bookshelf with a detailed view event.

Continue from Exercise 1 using the exercise files [provided here](https://github.com/TNBWorkshop/intro_mvc/blob/master/exercises/exercise_files.zip).

- Take a look at `views.js`. There are some custom views already started for you. Read through the code and try to get a feel for what's happening.

- Modify your code from `main.js` to use the App views inside of `views.js` instead of calling MVC.View directly.

- Modify the `BookThumbnailView`'s `onClick` function to create an instance of `BookDetailView`, assigned to the variable `detailView`.

- Test your changes in the browser to see if clicking on the thumbnail causes something to happen!
